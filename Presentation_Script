## Description of the project

The user can guess the means using the slider.

1. User sets the slider at certain value.

2. The red line indicating the value of the slider moves to its new location.

3. We can see the standard error calculation

## Examples of calculations 

Mu is the input value. Assume it has the value of 78. Below is the way I calculate the mean standard error. 

```{r}
mse<-mean((airquality$Temp - 78)^2)
```

The mean squared error will be `r round(mse,2)`

## Example of histogram

Below is the code I used to build histogram.  
```{r}
hist(airquality$Temp, xlab='Temperature', col='lightblue',main='Histogram of Temperature')
```

## Data description and sources

1. The data is taken from the airquality dataset, one of R's datasets. 

2. It represents daily air quality measurements in New York, May to September 1973.

3. There are 154 observations and 6 variables. 

4. I only looked at the value of temperature.

## Significance

This is a cool, simple App that allows to see how your predictions differ from the actual mean.
